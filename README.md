# mood-logger-app

This streamlit app project aims to support an Ops team in logging the mood of a patient ticket queue throughout the day. These moods are expressed with selected emojis and optionally a note. Submissions are collected with their timestamp in a separate Google Sheet.

The daily counts of these moods are also visualized via a bar chart below the logging form. If desired, the bar chart can be filtered to solely positive or negative moods. 

The app is accessable [here](https://mood-logger-app.streamlit.app/).
